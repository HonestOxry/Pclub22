I have created the main function in the class LoaningService which calls the functions of class lender (which inherits the class borrow) and creates the object of class lender (object name â€“ lr).
The program works as the following way: It takes the input such as name, age, contact number of borrower and other details such as bank name etc.
It also takes input the credit score and annual income of the borrower which is the main criteria for the borrower to get the loan according to the conditions fulfilled by the borrower imposed by the bank. 

Question 2
The loaning system I implemented is centralized.
Centralized system refers to a setup in which the decision-making powers are concentrated in a few leaders at the top of the organizational structure (Eg. Banks). Decisions are made at the top and communicated to lower-level managers for implementation.
